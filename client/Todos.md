**TODO:**

- Runtime (Movie page) seems to be wrong (e.g. check movie 'Underwater' - actual duration is 1h35m)

- use https://video-react.js.org/ and https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-videos to embed trailers for each movie
- Sort movies in the Cart by date added, rating, duration, etc.

- Link each cast member picture to a Google search by their name + movie name
- Destructure props inplace (from Redux, passed down, etc.) to clean up
- Use porpTypes in all components (most are missing now)
- Change the color/styling of a selectedTab
- Add reference to MOVIE DB website (licence)
- Add a cart for each user to keep their: 1) Watch Later 2) Already Watched (plus rating for each movie)
- Deploy on Heroku
- ~~Add auth using JWT/PassportJS~~
- ~~Add reommendations to the bottom of Movie page (based on current page, from Movie DB API)~~
- ~~Fix issue when there is only one cast member (e.g. http://localhost:3000/movie/36619)~~
- ~~Add the last tab visited to the store and use for router history~~
- ~~Add a placeholder image for movies that don't have cover image~~
- ~~Add Redux and keep the state there~~
